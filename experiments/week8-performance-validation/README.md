# Week 8: Performance Validation & Hypothesis Testing

## Overview

This experiment validates the core Phase 2 hypothesis: **"80% of coding tasks require only 10% of available context through intelligent selection"**

## Objectives

1. **Measure Token Reduction**: Compare optimized context selection against naive baseline across 20+ diverse real-world tasks
2. **Validate Quality**: Ensure 90%+ task completion quality with reduced context
3. **Profile Performance**: Analyze algorithm performance and identify optimization opportunities
4. **Test Hypothesis**: Statistically validate that 80% of tasks can use ≤10% of available context

## Experiment Design

### Task Categories

The experiment tests across 5 task types with varying complexity:

- **Feature Implementation** (5 tasks): Adding new functionality
- **Debugging** (4 tasks): Fixing bugs and issues
- **Refactoring** (4 tasks): Code restructuring and optimization
- **Testing** (3 tasks): Writing tests and benchmarks
- **Documentation** (2 tasks): Creating documentation
- **Complex Mixed** (3 tasks): Multi-faceted tasks

### Validation Metrics

1. **Token Reduction**
   - Baseline: All source files included (naive approach)
   - Optimized: Adaptive context selection
   - Target: 90%+ reduction

2. **Quality Assessment**
   - Task completion rate
   - Context completeness (missing vs excess files)
   - Strategy effectiveness by task type

3. **Performance Profile**
   - Algorithm execution time by strategy
   - Memory usage comparison
   - Hot path identification

## Running the Experiment

```bash
cd experiments/week8-performance-validation
go run experiment.go
```

### With CPU Profiling

```bash
CPU_PROFILE=true go run experiment.go
```

## Output

1. **Console Summary**: High-level results and hypothesis validation
2. **JSON Results**: `week8_performance_validation_results.json` - Detailed metrics
3. **Lab Report**: `docs/lab-reports/phase2-context-goldilocks-zone.md` - Comprehensive analysis

## Key Hypothesis Validation

The experiment validates the hypothesis by:

1. Counting tasks that achieve ≥90% token reduction (using ≤10% context)
2. Calculating the percentage of such tasks
3. Validating if this percentage ≥80%
4. Ensuring quality metrics remain above threshold (70%+)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ 80%+ of tasks use ≤10% of available context
- ✅ 90%+ task completion quality maintained
- ✅ <200ms selection time for most tasks
- ✅ Statistically significant results (p < 0.05)

## Phase 2 Completion

This experiment marks the completion of Phase 2 (Context Optimization) by:
- Validating the core hypothesis
- Demonstrating practical effectiveness
- Providing performance benchmarks
- Generating actionable recommendations for Phase 3
