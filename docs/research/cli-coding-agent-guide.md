# Building a CLI-based coding agent in GoLang: comprehensive implementation guide

This report provides actionable guidance for implementing a CLI-based coding agent in GoLang, focusing on the five key capabilities outlined in the teeny-orb project. The research combines insights from existing projects, GoLang-specific patterns, and proven architectural approaches to create a practical implementation roadmap.

## Key capability implementation strategies

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) implementation

**Core approach:** Implement MCP as the primary interface between your CLI agent and LLMs, enabling standardized file operations and tool access.

**Implementation strategy:**
- Use `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go` as the primary library - it offers the most mature, feature-complete MCP implementation with built-in recovery middleware and multiple transport options
- Structure your agent as an MCP server that exposes file operations, code execution, and project management tools
- Implement security-first file access with path validation, size limits, and allowlisted operations

**Practical code structure:**
```go
// Core MCP server setup
s := server.NewMCPServer("CLI Agent Server", "1.0.0",
    server.WithToolCapabilities(true),
    server.WithResourceCapabilities(true, true),
    server.WithRecovery())

// Add secure file operations
fileReadTool := mcp.NewTool("read_file",
    mcp.WithDescription("Read file contents"),
    mcp.WithString("path", mcp.Required()))
s.AddTool(fileReadTool, secureFileReadHandler)

// Dynamic file resources with security boundaries
template := mcp.NewResourceTemplate("file://{path}", 
    "File System Access")
s.AddResourceTemplate(template, secureFileResourceHandler)
```

**Security considerations:** Always validate file paths, implement root boundaries, enforce file size limits, and use allowlisting for operations. Never trust user input directly.

### LLM integration patterns

**Provider architecture approach:** Build a pluggable system using interfaces and factory patterns that can seamlessly switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, and local models.

**Implementation strategy:**
- Define a unified `LLMProvider` interface that abstracts chat, streaming, and tool calling capabilities
- Use a factory pattern with configuration-driven provider selection
- Implement middleware layers for retry logic, rate limiting, and error handling
- Support both streaming and non-streaming responses

**Core interface design:**
```go
type LLMProvider interface {
    Chat(ctx context.Context, req *ChatRequest) (*ChatResponse, error)
    ChatStream(ctx context.Context, req *ChatRequest) (<-chan *StreamResponse, error)
    GetModels(ctx context.Context) ([]Model, error)
}

// Standardized request/response structures
type ChatRequest struct {
    Messages    []Message `json:"messages"`
    Model       string    `json:"model"`
    MaxTokens   int       `json:"max_tokens,omitempty"`
    Temperature float64   `json:"temperature,omitempty"`
    Tools       []Tool    `json:"tools,omitempty"`
}
```

**Recommended libraries:**
- **OpenAI**: `github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai` - comprehensive, well-maintained
- **Anthropic**: `github.com/adamchol/go-anthropic-sdk` - supports latest Claude models
- **Local models**: Direct HTTP client for Ollama with custom implementation

**Error handling pattern:** Implement structured error types, exponential backoff with jitter, and graceful degradation with fallback providers.

### Container-based security

**Security-first approach:** Use Docker containers as secure sandboxes for code execution, with comprehensive resource limits and isolation.

**Implementation strategy:**
- Use the Docker SDK for Go (`github.com/docker/docker/client`) for container management
- Implement read-only root filesystems with specific writable volumes
- Apply strict resource limits (CPU, memory, processes, network)
- Use non-root users inside containers and proper capability management

**Secure container configuration:**
```go
config := &container.Config{
    Image: "secure-runtime:latest",
    User:  "1000:1000",
    SecurityOpt: []string{
        "no-new-privileges:true",
        "seccomp=default",
    },
}

hostConfig := &container.HostConfig{
    ReadonlyRootfs: true,
    Resources: container.Resources{
        Memory:    512 * 1024 * 1024, // 512MB
        CPUQuota:  50000,              // 50% CPU
    },
    CapDrop: []string{"ALL"},
    CapAdd:  []string{"CHOWN", "SETUID", "SETGID"}, // Minimal required
}
```

**Session management:** Implement container lifecycle management with automatic cleanup, session isolation per user, and garbage collection for expired containers.

### Context management

**Efficient context strategy:** Implement a multi-layered approach combining sliding windows, priority-based retention, and intelligent compression.

**Implementation approach:**
- Use `github.com/pkoukk/tiktoken-go` for accurate token counting across different models
- Implement sliding window with priority queues using Go's `container/heap`
- Add context compression through summarization and semantic deduplication
- Use memory pools and caching for performance optimization

**Core context manager structure:**
```go
type AdvancedContextManager struct {
    maxTokens      int
    slidingWindow  *SlidingWindow
    priorityQueue  *PriorityContextManager
    compressor     *SummarizationCompressor
    deduplicator   *SemanticDeduplicator
    cache          *ContextCache
    tokenizer      *TokenizerPool
}
```

**Performance patterns:** Use sync.Pool for object reuse, LRU caches for frequently accessed contexts, and concurrent processing for large context operations.

### Incremental development approach

**Phase-based development:** Structure development in testable increments that provide immediate learning value.

**Recommended development sequence:**

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation**
- Basic CLI structure with Cobra
- Configuration management with Viper
- Logging infrastructure (structured logging with slog)
- Error handling framework
- **Validation:** Unit tests, CLI help output, basic command execution

**Phase 2 (Weeks 3-5): Core agent logic**
- LLM provider integration with mock testing
- Basic code analysis (file reading, AST parsing)
- Simple code generation workflows
- **Validation:** Mock LLM provider tests, various file format support

**Phase 3 (Weeks 6-8): Enhanced functionality**
- Interactive prompts and user input
- Progress indicators for long operations
- File system operations (backup, restore)
- **Validation:** End-to-end workflow testing, user interaction scenarios

**Phase 4 (Weeks 9+): Advanced features**
- TUI interface with Bubbletea
- Plugin system
- Performance optimization and caching
- **Validation:** Load testing, user acceptance testing

## Testing strategies by component

**MCP testing:** Use MCP Inspector for protocol validation, mock transports for unit testing, and testcontainers for integration testing.

**LLM integration testing:** Combine mock providers for unit tests, httptest servers for integration tests, and property-based testing for robustness.

**Container security testing:** Use testcontainers for secure execution validation, automated security scanning, and vulnerability assessment.

**Context management testing:** Implement token counting accuracy tests, memory usage profiling, and performance benchmarks.

## Common pitfalls to avoid

**Architecture mistakes:**
- Don't put business logic in command handlers - extract to separate packages
- Avoid monolithic provider implementations - use pluggable interfaces
- Don't skip error context - provide actionable error messages

**Performance bottlenecks:**
- Implement request batching for LLM calls
- Use streaming for large file processing
- Add intelligent caching with configurable TTL

**Security issues:**
- Never trust user input for file paths
- Implement proper container escape prevention
- Use secure secrets management (never embed in code)

## Getting started immediately

1. **Set up the basic CLI structure** using Cobra with a simple `version` and `help` command
2. **Implement configuration management** with Viper supporting both files and environment variables
3. **Create a mock LLM provider** to start testing the provider interface pattern
4. **Add basic file reading capabilities** with security validation
5. **Write comprehensive tests** for each component as you build

This approach allows you to start coding immediately while building toward a robust, production-ready CLI coding agent. Each phase provides working functionality that can be tested and validated, ensuring continuous learning and rapid iteration.

The key to success is starting simple, testing everything, and incrementally adding complexity while maintaining clean interfaces and separation of concerns throughout the development process.
